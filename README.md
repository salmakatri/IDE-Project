## Question/Need
Current real estate markets have been experiencing increasing prices and bidding wars across the country. Homebuyers need to do their own research to understand market trends and conditions to make informed decisions. While available separately on websites such as Redfin, useful information like average sale price by sqft and by type, average days on the market, average over/under ask are not readily available and aggregated in a user-friendly interface.  This project aims at building interactive dashboards to display up-to-date housing market trends, key statistics and graphs. 

## Data Description
The dataset is downloaded and scraped from Redfin consisting of recently sold houses in different major US cities. The data includes different variables obtained from Redfin for each house such as sold price,  sqft, house type and days on the market. These features are then used to calculate different statistics during the pipeline phase to be displayed in the final dashboard. 

## Tools
BeautifulSoup for data scraping
SQL for data storage
Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
Streamlit and Plotly for building dasboard web app

## MVP 
A sample dashboard to display how the final product will look like
